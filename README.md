Designed for students, electricians, and technicians who need quick electrical power calculations.



✨ Features

Calculations:

\- Active Power (P) – useful power

\- Reactive Power (Q) – inductive/capacitive component

\- Apparent Power (S) – total power

Supports single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase systems

Automatic input validation (voltage out of range is highlighted with a red background)

Preset values for quick testing

Modern look with custom styles using ttk.Style

Keyboard shortcuts:

\- Ctrl+N – new calculation

\- Ctrl+Q – exit application

\- F1 – About window

About window includes explanation of power factor and typical values for various loads

* ESC - close About window
